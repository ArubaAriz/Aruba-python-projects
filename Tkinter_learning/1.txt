Physicists worldwide are racing to develop ultra-powerful lasers, with China's Shanghai Superintense Ultrafast Laser Facility (SULF) leading the charge to achieve 100-petawatt pulses capable of "breaking the vacuum" and creating matter from empty space. This ambition extends beyond breaking records, aiming for applications in astrophysics, materials science, particle acceleration for medicine, and high-energy physics. Despite competition from Europe, Russia, and Japan, U.S. scientists are working to catch up in this high-power laser race.
